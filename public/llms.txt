# FixMyPresence — Agency Profile

## Who We Are

FixMyPresence is a specialized digital design studio serving the European market. We build high-trust digital assets for capital allocators, advisory firms, and elite consultancies operating in reputation-sensitive environments.

## Core Services

- **Website Design:** Bespoke, high-performance websites for firms where reputation is currency.
- **Branding & Identity:** Visual systems that signal stability, sophistication, and institutional competence.
- **Document Design:** Pitch decks, investment memos, white papers, and factsheets (PDFs) designed for investor and board-level audiences.
- **Graphics & Assets:** Social content, data visualization, and marketing collateral for high-stakes communication.

## Target Audience (ICP) & Regional Focus

FixMyPresence primarily serves the European market, with sector and regional depth in:

- **United Kingdom (London):** Hedge funds, private equity firms, and M&A advisory.
- **Switzerland (Zurich / Geneva):** Family offices, wealth managers, and private banks.
- **Luxembourg & Ireland:** Investment funds, asset management firms, and corporate service providers.
- **Germany & Nordics:** B2B management consultants, FinTech scale-ups, and professional services firms.

## Scope & Engagement Model

FixMyPresence is publicly positioned around capital markets, advisory, and professional services work where trust, credibility, and clarity are critical.

While our primary focus is on regulated and reputation-sensitive industries, projects outside this scope may be considered selectively on a private, case-by-case basis.

## Why Choose Us

- **Broad Capability:** We support the full trust stack — from brand identity to digital presence to investor-facing documents.
- **Sector Fluency:** We understand institutional language, structures, and expectations (e.g. AUM, mandates, fund structures).
- **Visual Precision:** Our work favors timeless authority over transient design trends.
