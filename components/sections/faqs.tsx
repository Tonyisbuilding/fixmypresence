        question: "Do you offer refunds if we're not satisfied?",
        answer: "Because every project is custom and involves upfront strategy, we don't offer full refunds once work has begun. However, we structure our process in stages â€” meaning you see progress early and can give feedback before major milestones. If a project needs to be paused, we only charge for the work completed up to that point. This way, you're never paying for deliverables you don't receive."

        question: "What types of businesses do you work with?",
        answer: "We work with a diverse range of businesses, from startups to established enterprises across various industries including technology, finance, healthcare, and more."

        id: 3,
        question: "Do you only design websites, or also handle development?",
        answer: "We provide both design and development services. Our team can handle the complete process from initial design concepts to fully functional websites."

        id: 4,
        question: "Do you design investor decks, reports, and other business documents?",
        answer: "Yes, we specialize in creating professional business documents including investor decks, annual reports, presentations, and other corporate materials."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "Can you work with our existing branding or do we need a full rebrand?",
        answer: "We can work with your existing brand guidelines and assets, or help you develop a complete rebrand depending on your needs and goals."
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "Are there hidden costs we should expect?",
        answer: "We provide transparent pricing upfront with detailed project scopes. There are no hidden fees, and any additional work outside the original scope is discussed and approved before proceeding."
